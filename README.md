# Investigating the Iris Dataset #

## Background ##

The iris dataset is a model 'toy' dataset within the scikit-learn website, which provides data about the size of three different species of iris. The species of interest include Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. A total of 150 plants were measured in this study, with an even spread of 50 plants from each of the three species type. Four key measurements were taken from each plant, including the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. 
The following data exploration was conducted to identify whether these different measurements could be used to predict the iris species. This may offer a more facile method of identification of iris species in the wild, by performing a brief assessment by measuring petal length or width to determine the identity of an unknown iris plant of interest.

## Methods ##

Since the dataset explored in this code is a model 'toy' dataset, the iris dataset can be easily loaded from scikit-learn following the code included in the **Iris.ipynb** file. The dataset was initially named **" iris "**, however the code had to be modified to present the data in a tabular format, therefore the dataset was subsequently renamed as **" iris_df "**.
To run the code within the **Iris.ipynb** file, open the **Iris.ipynb** file in JupyterLab. The code for loading the required software packages to fully explore the data as intended were all included within the code at each necessary point throughout the exploratory pipeline. 
These packages include:
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
