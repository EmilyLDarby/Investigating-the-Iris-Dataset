# Investigating the Iris Dataset #

## Introduction ##

The iris dataset is a model 'toy' dataset within the scikit-learn website, which provides data about the size of three different species of iris. The species of interest include Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. A total of 150 plants were measured in this study, with an even spread of 50 plants from each of the three species type. Four key measurements were taken from each plant, including the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. 
The following data exploration was conducted to identify whether these different measurements could be used to predict the iris species. This may offer a more facile method of identification of iris species in the wild, by performing a brief assessment by measuring petal length or width to determine the identity of an unknown iris plant of interest.
